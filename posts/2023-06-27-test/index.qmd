Hi everyone, welcome to my new, shiny, [quarto](https://quarto.org/)-based web-site.

Before that, I was using Jekyll, as recommended by the [github
pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) documentation. However, Jekyll is
really overkill for a simple academic website (and a simpleton like myself). I
tried different things, and ended up using this
[template](https://academicpages.github.io/), but I found it difficult to adapt
to my needs (and it's not maintained anymore).

Long story short: I have just switched to [quarto](https://quarto.org/), and I
am very glad I did. I manage to do more advanced things (like adding
a blog) in much less time. 

Also, math support is great: $2+\int_0^1 f(x) dx$. You can also type code: 
```{python}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
