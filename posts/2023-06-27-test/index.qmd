Hi everyone, welcome to my new, shiny, [quarto](https://quarto.org/)-based web-site.

Before that, I was using Jekyll, as recommended by the [github
pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) documentation. However, Jekyll is
really overkill for a simple academic website (and a simpleton like myself). I
tried different things, and ended up using this
[template](https://academicpages.github.io/), but I found it difficult to adapt
to my needs (and it's not maintained anymore).

Long story short: I have just switched to [quarto](https://quarto.org/), and I
am very glad I did. I manage to do more advanced things (like adding
a blog) in much less time. 

Also, math support is great: $2+\int_0^1 f(x) dx$. You can also type code: 
```{python}
#| label: lab
#| fig-cap: "Scatter plot of a Gaussian Sobol sample"
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

sob = stats.qmc.Sobol(2)
u = sob.random(4096)  # must be a power of 2
z = stats.norm.ppf(u)
x = z
rho = 0.9
x[:, 1] += rho * z[:, 0] + np.sqrt(1. - rho**2) * z[:, 1]

plt.figure()
plt.style.use('ggplot')
plt.scatter(x[:, 0], x[:, 1], alpha=0.5)
plt.show()
```
