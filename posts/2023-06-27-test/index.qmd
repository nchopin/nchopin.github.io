Hi everyone, welcome to my new, shiny, [quarto](https://quarto.org/)-based web-site.

I moved my website to github a few years ago, and tried to use Jekyll, as
recommended by the [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
documentation. However, Jekyll seems to be a bit overkill for a simple academic
website. I tried to start from this
[template](https://academicpages.github.io/), but I found it difficult to adapt
it even a little bit (and it's not maintained anymore)

Bottom line: I strongly recommend [quarto](https://quarto.org/), it took me much less time to obtain
the website I am happy with, it also looks more flexible (for my use), the
documentation is great, and I even managed to add this blog (which is not
something I dared to do with Jekyll).

Also, math support is great: $2+\int_0^1 f(x) dx$. You can also type code: 
```{python}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
