However, Jekyll is\nreally overkill for a simple academic website (and a simpleton like myself). I\ntried different things, and ended up using this\n[template](https://academicpages.github.io/), but I found it difficult to adapt\nto my needs (and it's not maintained anymore).\n\nLong story short: I have just switched to [quarto](https://quarto.org/), and I\nam very glad I did. I manage to do more advanced things (like adding\na blog) in much less time. \n\nAlso, math support is great: $2+\\int_0^1 f(x) dx$. You can also type code: \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import stats\n\nsob = stats.qmc.Sobol(2)\nu = sob.random(4096)  # must be a power of 2\nz = stats.norm.ppf(u)\nx = z\nrho = 0.9\nx[:, 1] += rho * z[:, 0] + np.sqrt(1. - rho**2) * z[:, 1]\n\nplt.figure()\nplt.style.use('ggplot')\nplt.scatter(x[:, 0], x[:, 1], alpha=0.5)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Scatter plot of a Gaussian Sobol sample](index_files/figure-html/lab-output-1.png){#lab width=569 height=411}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
