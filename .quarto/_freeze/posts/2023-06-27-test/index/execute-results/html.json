However, Jekyll seems to be a bit overkill for a simple academic\nwebsite. I tried to start from this\n[template](https://academicpages.github.io/), but I found it difficult to adapt\nit even a little bit (and it's not maintained anymore)\n\nBottom line: I strongly recommend [quarto](https://quarto.org/), it took me much less time to obtain\nthe website I am happy with, it also looks more flexible (for my use), the\ndocumentation is great, and I even managed to add this blog (which is not\nsomething I dared to do with Jekyll).\n\nAlso, math support is great: $2+\\int_0^1 f(x) dx$. You can also type code: \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(\n  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} \n)\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![A line plot on a polar axis](index_files/figure-html/fig-polar-output-1.png){#fig-polar width=450 height=439}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
