## About me

I am a Professor of Data Sciences/Statistics/Machine Learning at
[ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/en/), [Institut Polytechnique de
Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en).

I am particularly interested in all aspects of **Bayesian computation**, that
is algorithms to perform Bayesian inference, including: 

* Monte Carlo methods: particularly Sequential Monte Carlo, but also plain,
  quasi- and Markov chain Monte Carlo;

* fast approximations: e.g. Expectation Propagation and variational Bayes.

On this site you can find more information on the [book](books.html) I
co-authored on SMC, the python library I am developing,
[particles](software.html), and a full list of my [publications](papers.html).
I also [blog](blog.html) from time to time. 

## Editorial responsibilities

I am currently an Associate editor of the following journals:

* [Annals of Statistics](https://imstat.org/journals-and-publications/annals-of-statistics/)

* [Biometrika](https://academic.oup.com/biomet)

I rarely find the time to review papers for other journals, sorry.
