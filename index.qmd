## About me

I am a Professor of Data Sciences/Statistics/Machine Learning at
[ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/en/), [Institut Polytechnique de
Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en).

I am interested in all aspects of **Bayesian computation**, that is
algorithms to perform Bayesian inference, including: 

* Monte Carlo methods: particularly Sequential Monte Carlo, but also plain,
  quasi- and Markov chain Monte Carlo;

* fast approximations: e.g. Expectation Propagation and variational Bayes.

Omiros Papaspiliopoulos and I wrote a book on Sequential Monte Carlo, see 
[here](books.html); for the accompanying python library, see
[here](software.html).

## Editorial responsibilities

I am currently an Associate editor for:

* [Annals of Statistics](https://imstat.org/journals-and-publications/annals-of-statistics/)

* [Biometrika](https://academic.oup.com/biomet)

I rarely find the time to review extra papers for other journals, sorry.
